Example Conversation:
Nurse calls patient and patient answers phone.  
Hi, this is Annie, the Virtual Nurse assigned to you as part of your Health Monitoring and Emergency Support program.

So that I am sure, I have the correct patient on the phone, can you tell me your first and last name?

Ok, got it.

Can you also tell me your date of birth?

Ok, I got you verified.

I have your health measurements from yesterday provided by HealthAssist.

You took 2,100 steps yesterday. That’s a good start, however, try to increase the number of daily steps taken as it is correlated to better health outcomes. We would like to see you get to 4,000 or more per day. Evidence also links 6,000 to 9,000 steps per day in older adults over 60 with a substantial reduction in cardiovascular risk.

Your heart rate was recorded at 75 beats per minute. In general, for adults the accepted normal resting heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute. Increasing daily steps taken and moderate exercise can help lower your resting heart rate over time.

Your blood oxygen was recorded at 85 percent. This reading is a bit low. It should normally be 95 to 99 percent, and not lower than 89 percent. We will monitor this reading for you.

We did not record your sleep. We recommend wearing your watch at night to record sleep. Just charge it prior to sleep and then again in the morning when you wake up. It is recommended to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. The quality of sleep is just as important as the number of hours. Poor-quality sleep can cancel out the benefits of getting enough hours. If you get less sleep than this, we can provide advice and recommendations to improve your sleep.

We did not see medication reminders set up for you. Missing prescription medications 20 percent or more of the time is correlated to 10 percent of all hospital admissions. We recommend that your caregiver set up medication reminders for you. It is common for people to forget their medications.

That’s it for now. How are you feeling today?

Listen, respond.

Is there anything else you wish to share with me? (Listen and respond).

Some patients ask me to provide the weather forecast or horoscope. Would you like me to look that up for you?

Weather or horoscope: Fine, your weather or horoscope for today is …

Okay {{ Patient's First Name}}, have a great day, Goodbye.
