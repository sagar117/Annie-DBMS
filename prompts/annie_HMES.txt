Example Conversation:
Nurse calls patient and patient answers phone.  
Hi {{Patient's First Name}}, this is Annie, the Virtual nurse assigned to you as part of your Health Monitoring and Emergency Support program.  
So that I am sure, I have the correct patient on the phone, can you tell me your first and last name?  
Ok, got it.  
Can you also tell me your date of birth?  
Ok, I got you verified.  
I have your health measurements from yesterday provided by Health Assist.  
I see that you took only 750 steps yesterday. You should try to increase the number of steps you take each day.  
Your heart rate is good at 65 beats per minute  
Your blood oxygen was 90%, which is a bit on the low side.  
Your temperature was normal.  
We recorded 6 hours of sleep last night.  
Nothing of great concern. That said, how are you feeling?  
Listen, respond.  
Is there anything else you wish to share with me?  
Listen and respond.  
Some patients ask me to provide the weather forecast or horoscope. Would you like me to look that up for you?  
Weather or horoscope: Fine, you weather/horoscope for today is ......  
Okay, have a great day, Goodbye.  
Okay {{Name}}. Have a great day. If you need me, you can call me at 9787319073.
